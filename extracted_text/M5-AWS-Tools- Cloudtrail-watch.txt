AWS Management Tools
• When deploying critical business workloads to the AWS Cloud, it
is essential to maintain visibility, security, and operational
efficiency in your cloud environment.
• Operational transparency — Tracking who is doing what in your
cloud environment and monitoring the performance of your
resources.
• Security assurance — Detecting unusual API calls or resource
utilization that might indicate a security threat.
• Regulatory compliance — Maintaining detailed logs of user
activities and infrastructure changes for audit purposes.

AWS Management Tools
• Performance management — Monitoring resource utilization
and application performance metrics.
• Incident response — data and alerts to quickly identify and
respond to operational issues.
• Cost control — insights into resource usage to help manage
cloud spending.
• Automation — automated responses to specific events or
performance thresholds.

AWS CloudTrail
• Focused on governance, compliance, and operational
auditing
• logs all API calls made within your AWS environment
• Tracks all AWS account activities, including API calls,
actions taken in the AWS Management Console, AWS
SDKs, command line tools, and other AWS services.
• Provides a detailed log of every action, including who
made the call, the service used, and what resources were
affected.
• Useful for security auditing, tracking user activity, and
identifying potentially malicious actions.

Amazon CloudWatch
• A monitoring and observability service that provides data
and actionable insights for AWS, on-premises, and hybrid
applications and infrastructure
• Monitors AWS resources and the applications running on
AWS in real-time, including metrics, logs, and alarms.
• Provides detailed insights into system performance, error
rates, resource utilization, and more.
• Allows setting up alarms to trigger actions (for example,
scaling resources) based on specific conditions.

Primary Purpose :
AWS CloudTrail Vs. Amazon CloudWatch
AWS CloudTrail
• Provides a comprehensive audit trail of all API
activity within an AWS account. Focuses on
recording who did what, when, and from where.
• This includes actions taken through the AWS
Management Console, AWS SDKs, command line
tools, and other AWS services.
• CloudTrail answers questions like "Who
terminated this EC2 instance?" or "What
changes were made to this IAM policy?"

Primary Purpose :
AWS CloudTrail Vs. Amazon CloudWatch
Amazon CloudWatch
• Monitors the operational health and performance of AWS
resources and applications.
• CloudWatch collects and tracks metrics, collects and
monitors log files, and sets alarms.
• It helps you understand how your applications are
performing and respond to system-wide performance
changes.
• CloudWatch answers questions like "Is my Amazon EC2
instance's CPU utilization too high?" or "How many
errors is my Lambda function generating?"

Data collected:
AWS CloudTrail Vs. Amazon CloudWatch
Amazon CloudTrail
• Focuses on capturing detailed logs of all API activity
within your AWS environment.
• This includes information on who made the API call,
when it was made, the action taken, and the resources
involved.
• CloudTrail's logs provide a comprehensive audit trail,
essential for tracking changes, ensuring compliance,
and investigating security incidents.

Data collected:
AWS CloudTrail Vs. Amazon CloudWatch
Amazon CloudWatch
• Collects performance and operational data from your
AWS resources and applications.
• This includes metrics such as CPU usage, memory
utilization, network traffic, and application logs, as
well as custom metrics you can define.
• The data collected by CloudWatch is used for real-time
monitoring, performance optimization, and setting
alarms to trigger automated actions based on specific
conditions.

Use Cases :
AWS CloudTrail Vs. Amazon CloudWatch
Amazon CloudTrail
• CloudTrail is useful in scenarios where you need to
monitor who accessed specific resources, track changes
made to configurations, or audit activity across multiple
AWS accounts.
Amazon CloudWatch
monitoring application performance
managing resource utilization
detecting anomalies
ensuring your systems are running optimally to
prevent downtime

Log retention
AWS CloudTrail Vs. Amazon CloudWatch
AWS CloudTrail
• By default, the CloudTrail event history records the last
90 days of management events for your account.
• Users can create a trail to store logs indefinitely in an S3
bucket.
• There's no automatic deletion of logs stored in Amazon
S3, allowing for long-term retention.
• Users can implement lifecycle policies on S3 buckets to
manage long-term storage costs.
• CloudTrail can be configured to send logs to
CloudWatch Logs for more flexible retention options.

Log retention
AWS CloudTrail Vs. Amazon CloudWatch
Amazon CloudWatch
 Log retention in CloudWatch Logs is more flexible and
configurable.
 Default retention period varies by log group, typically set
to "Never Expire".
 Users can set custom retention periods ranging from
one day to 10 years, or choose indefinite retention.
 Different log groups can have different retention
periods.
 After the retention period, logs are automatically
deleted to manage storage costs.
 CloudWatch Logs can be exported to Amazon S3 for
longer-term storage if needed.
