Simple Storage Service(S3)
Amazon S3 has a simple web services interface that you can use to store
●
and retrieve any amount of data, at any time, from anywhere on the
web.
Amazon Simple Storage Service is storage for the Internet. It is designed
●
to make web-scale computing easier for developers.
It gives any developer access to the same highly scalable, reliable, fast,
●
inexpensive data storage infrastructure that Amazon uses to run its own
global network of web sites.
The service aims to maximize benefits of scale and to pass those benefits
●
on to developers.

●
S3 is primarily used for:-
Store and Backup
●
Application File Hosting
●
Media Hosting

Simple Storage Service(S3)
Objects Consists of the following
Key – this is simply the file name of the object
●
Value – the data and it is made up of a sequence of bytes.
●
Versioning – which version of the object is this
●
Meta Data - Data about data, the data about the data file you are storing.
●
Think, if you are storing a music track/song. This would have metadata like
●
the information of the singer, the year it was released, the name of the
album etc.

S3 Storage Classes
S3 (Durable, immediately available and frequently accessed)
●
S3 – IA (durable, immediately available, infrequently accessed)
●
S3 Reduced Redundancy Storage (Used for data that is easily
●
reproducible, such thumbnails)
S3 Express one zone – latest – 10 times faster access with reduced cost
●
7

--- Page 8 ---
S3 – IA (Infrequently Accessed) For data that is accessed less frequently
●
but requires rapid access when needed. This here costs lesser than S3 but
you are charged for the retrieval of the data.
S3 – RRS (Reduced Redundancy Storage) Basically less durability with the
●
same level of availability.
e.g. This about data you could potentially regenerate like a tax calculation
or a payslip. This is cheaper than the original SS. Suppose you create
thumbnails for all your pictures. If you lose a thumbnail you could always
regenerate it.
When deciding which storage to use think about the various storage
●
options, their advantages vs disadvantages. Are you optimizing for
durability, the frequency of retrieval or availability?

How Amazon S3 works?
Amazon S3 is an object storage service, which differs from other types of cloud
●
computing storage types, such as block and file storage.
Each object is stored as a file with its metadata included.
●
The object is also given an ID number. Applications use this ID number to access
●
objects.
This is unlike file and block cloud storage, where a developer can access an object via
●
a representational state transfer (REST) API.
The S3 object storage cloud service gives a subscriber access to the same systems that
●
Amazon uses to run its own websites. S3 enables customers to upload, store and
download practically any file or object that is up to 5 terabytes (TB) in size -- with the
largest single upload capped at 5 gigabytes (GB).
Every object is encrypted with a unique key.

Simple Storage Service(S3)
Amazon S3 is object storage built to store and retrieve any amount of data from
●
anywhere on the Internet.
It’s a simple storage service that offers an extremely durable, highly available, and
●
infinitely scalable data storage infrastructure at very low costs.
Amazon S3 provides a simple web service interface that you can use to store and
●
retrieve any amount of data, at any time, from anywhere on the web.
Using this web service, you can easily build applications that make use of Internet
●
storage. Since Amazon S3 is highly scalable and you only pay for what you use, you
can start small and grow your application as you wish, with no compromise on
performance or reliability.

Protecting Data
Data stored in Amazon S3 is secure by default
●
Amazon S3 supports multiple access control mechanisms.
●
With Amazon S3’s data protection features, you can protect your data from both
●
logical and physical failures, guarding against data loss from unintended user actions,
application errors, and infrastructure failures.
For customers who must comply with regulatory standards, Amazon S3’s data
●
protection features can be used as part of an overall strategy to achieve compliance.

Data security and reliability features offered by Amazon S3
1. Audit Logs
Amazon S3 also supports logging of requests made against your Amazon S3 resources. You can
●
configure your Amazon S3 bucket to create access log records for the requests made against it. These
server access logs capture all requests made against a bucket or the objects in it and can be used for
auditing purposes.
CloudWatch collects metrics, logs, dashboards, alarms, and insights.
●
CloudTrail records API activity for governance, compliance, and auditing.
●
2. Versioning
Amazon S3 provides further protection with versioning capability.
You can use versioning to preserve, retrieve, and restore every version of every object stored in your
●
Amazon S3 bucket.
This allows you to easily recover from both unintended user actions and application failures. By default,
●
requests will retrieve the most recently written version. Older versions of an object can be retrieved by
specifying a version in the request.
12

3. Data Security Details
Amazon S3 provides four different access control mechanisms:
Identity and Access Management (IAM) policies,
●
Access Control Lists (ACLs),
●
bucket policies,
●
query string authentication.
●
IAM enables organizations with multiple employees to create and manage multiple users under a single
●
AWS account.
With IAM policies, you can grant IAM users fine-grained control to your Amazon S3 bucket or objects.
●
You can use ACLs to selectively add (grant) certain permissions on individual objects.
●
Amazon S3 Bucket Policies can be used to add or deny permissions across some or all of the objects
●
within a single bucket.
With Query string authentication, you have ability to share Amazon S3 objects through URLs that are
●
valid for a predefined expiration time.

Advantages of using Amazon S3
Amazon S3 is intentionally built with a minimal feature set that focuses on simplicity and robustness.
●
Following are some of the advantages of using Amazon S3:
Creating buckets – Create and name a bucket that stores data. Buckets are the fundamental containers
●
in Amazon S3 for data storage.
Storing data – Store an infinite amount of data in a bucket. Upload as many objects as you like into an
●
Amazon S3 bucket. Each object can contain up to 5 TB of data. Each object is stored and retrieved using
a unique developer-assigned key.
Downloading data – Download your data or enable others to do so. Download your data anytime you
●
like, or allow others to do the same.
Permissions – Grant or deny access to others who want to upload or download data into your Amazon
●
S3 bucket. Grant upload and download permissions to three types of users. Authentication mechanisms
can help keep data secure from unauthorized access.
Standard interfaces – Use standards-based REST and SOAP interfaces designed to work with any
●
internet-development toolkit.

Amazon Glacier
S3 Glacier is an extremely low-cost storage service that provides durable storage with
●
security features for data archiving and backup.
With S3 Glacier, customers can store their data cost effectively for months, years, or
●
even decades.
S3 Glacier enables customers to offload the administrative burdens of operating and
●
scaling storage to AWS, so they don't have to worry about capacity planning, hardware
provisioning, data replication, hardware failure detection and recovery, or time-
consuming hardware migrations

Amazon Glacier
A developer uses a cold data cloud service such as Amazon Glacier to move
●
infrequently accessed data to archival storage to save money on storage costs. He can
also move database backups from tape storage media to the cloud for long-term
Glacier storage.
Archives and vaults
A vault is a container for storing archives.
●
Amazon Glacier stores data in archives and vaults.
●
An archive is a block of data that may consist of a single file or aggregated data in the
●
form of TAR or zip files.
Glacier archives range in size from 1 byte to 40 terabytes (TB); there are no limits to
●
how much data and how many archives an AWS user can store in Glacier. Amazon
offers a multipart upload feature for higher throughput and reliability for archives over
100 MB.

S3 Lifecycle Management
Using Amazon S3 lifecycle configuration rules,
One can significantly reduce your storage costs by automatically
●
transitioning data from one storage class to another or even
automatically deleting data after a period of time.
For example, the lifecycle rules for backup data might be:
●
Store backup data initially in Amazon S3 Standard.
○
After 30 days, transition to Amazon Standard-IA.
○
After 90 days, transition to Amazon Glacier.
○
After 3 years, delete.
○
Lifecycle configurations are attached to the bucket and can apply to all
●
objects in the bucket or only to objects specified by a prefix.
